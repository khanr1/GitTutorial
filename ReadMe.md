# Starting a new project

In general, the first thing to when starting a new project (independently of git hub) is to create a folder where the root of the project will be for the purpose of these notes I created a folder named GitTutorial. To initialize the repository we go in the folder that we just create and type `git init`

```bash
mkdir GitTutorial
cd GitTutorial
git init
```
